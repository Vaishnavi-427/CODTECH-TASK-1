## OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT 

### PROJECT : WEATHER MONITORING STATION

### OBJECTIVE 
The objective of a real-time weather monitoring system using IoT is to collect, analyze, and disseminate weather data in real-time. This system aims to provide accurate and up-to-dateweather information to users, enabling them to make informed decisions and take necessary precautions based on the current weather conditions. The system also helps in tracking and predicting weather patterns, providing early warning alerts for potential natural disasters, and im-proving the overall efficiency and effectiveness of weather-related activities.

## KEY ACTIVITIES
1. Collects meteorological data.
2. Analyzes atmospheric conditions.
3. Monitors weather patterns.
4. Issues forecasts and warnings.
5. Provides climate research data.

### TECHNOLOGIES USED
-**TINKERCAD** : Weather monitoring station using Tinkercad utilize sensors for temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, rainfall, wind speed and gas sensor value with circuit design.  
-**ThingSpeak** : For data collection and visualization of the output data.

### CONCLUSION 
In conclusion, weather monitoring stations play a crucial role in collecting and analyzing meteorological data to understand atmospheric conditions and predict weather patterns.Tinkercad facilitates the design and simulation of sensor circuits, enabling efficient prototyping and testing. ThingSpeak provides a powerful platform for data collection, storage, and real-time visualization. This integration ensures accurate monitoring of temperature, humidity, pressure, and other weather parameters. By leveraging these technologies, we enhance our ability to predict weather patterns, issue timely warnings, and conduct in-depth climate research, ultimately improving our preparedness and response to weather-related events.
